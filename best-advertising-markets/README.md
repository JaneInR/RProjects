## Analysis of the Best Advertising Markets

This project shows how to use R Markdown to create a reproducible data analysis workflow.
Using descriptive statistics and data visualization, the analysis assesses possible advertising regions by looking at participant distribution and monthly spending trends.

Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, outlier management, and written interpretation are all part of the project.
A repeatable HTML report created from a R Markdown file presents the findings.

To view the complete analysis and results, please refer to the R Markdown file or the output folder.
