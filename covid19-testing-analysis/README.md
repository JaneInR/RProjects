## Analysis of COVID-19 Testing

This project uses R Markdown to show a reproducible data analysis workflow.
In order to compare nations based on testing volume and the proportion of positive cases, the analysis looks at COVID-19 testing and case data.

Data cleaning, data aggregation, exploratory analysis, and statistical summaries are all part of the project.
Results are presented in a reproducible HTML report generated from an R Markdown file.

Please refer to the output folder or the R Markdown file to view the full analysis and results.
