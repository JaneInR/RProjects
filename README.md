## R Projects

A small portfolio of repeatable data analysis projects created with R and R Markdown can be found in this repository.
Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, statistical summaries, reporting, and other end-to-end analytical workflows are all demonstrated in the projects.

Each project is organized in its own folder and includes a reproducible R Markdown analysis with rendered HTML output.
The analyses address real-world questions across different domains, such as market analysis and public health data analysis.

To see the complete analyses and outcomes, please look through each project folder.
